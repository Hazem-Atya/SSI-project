# SSI project
### This project was created during our introduction to systems security workshops



## Run the project

* To generate the data dictionary in linux you can use this command    
crunch 26 26 -t @@@@@@.@@@@@@insat.ucar.tn  -l aaaaaa.aaaaa@insat.ucar.tn -s robert.smith@insat.ucar.tn -o randomEmails.txt -c 30000000
* run the main file    
python3 main_menu.py
 
## Important!
Before running the project please create a file ./config/constants.py    
The constants.py file contains the email credentials used for sending OTP while logging in.    
the structure of the constans file is:    
emailCredentials = dict(    
    email='xxxxx@xxx.com',    
    password="xxxxxxx"    
)
